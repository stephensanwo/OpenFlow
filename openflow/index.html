              OpenFlow is an open source low-code analytics automation workflow,
              that decouples monolithic analytics projects into re-usable
              functional components that can be chained together to solve a
              problem. It provides a seamless platform for developers to deploy
              modular functions that can be re-used by other developers,
              analysts and non-coders for automated analytics and robotic
              process automation (RPA).
            </p>
            <p>
              OpenFlow attempts to improve the collaboration between business
              process owners (who are typically non-coders), and developers, by
              providing an infrastructure where developers can share pre-written
              functions, targeted at solving specific use cases, which consumers
              can then mix and match while building their workflows using a
              simple user interface.
            </p>
            <h2>Why OpenFlow?</h2>
            <p>
              Having worked in analytics and automation for some really complex
              use cases, Multilayered analytics can become complex and tedious
              quickly. A useful approach will be to break down the analytics
              into modular functions that can be called anytime. These functions
              may be built by you or some other person, but the very basic
              principle is that the function will take an input of a range of
              data structures and return an output. These functions can then be
              mixed and matched in multiple ways to create a workflow that
              solves a specific problem. For example, a simple reconciliation
              work flow between two different data sources could involve the
              following:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>1. Data extraction from source system A</li>
              <li>2. Data extraction from source system B</li>
              <li>
                3. Run a basic probabilistic fuzzy match on specific columns
              </li>
              <li>
                4. Or Run a more advanced ML-based matching algorithm where a
                unique identifier does not exist
              </li>
              <li>5. Extract reconciliation reports, and send by email</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each of these work steps can be created as simple functions and
              chained together in a workflow that can run on a monthly basis.

              With OpenFlow, developers can create re-usable functions, and wrap
              them with a simple user interface, where consumers can easily
              provide the variables required by those functions, and chain these
              functions together a s part of a larger workflow. For example, the
              reconciliation workflow will have 4 functions for each step, two
              of which are not necessarily related to a reconciliation procedure
              itself (extracting data from source systems and sending reports to
              an email address)
            </p>
            <p>
              A business owner (consumer) can provide the required variables to
              run the workflow and reuse, batch or schedule data operations.
              From a developer point of view, you wouldnâ€™t need to provide an
              API or use a tool like streamlit for every application you want
              some users to consume. You can embed your functions in OpenFlow
              and mix and match the logic for your workflow as you wish. From a
              business owner point of view, you have the flexibility to go
              beyond a preset workflow logic set by the developer and construct
              your own logic.

            <h2>How it Works</h2>
            <p>
              OpenFlow is a collection of worfklows that solve an analytics
              problem or automates a process. The basic unit of a flow is the
              node and you can have infinite nodes in a flow. Nodes are
              essentially functions that take an input and generate an output.
              The output is either passed on to a subsequent node, multiple
              subsequent nodes, or as a final output. A node can also either be
              a component node or a code node.
            </p>
            <p>
              A component node is a function has been pre built and tested by a
              contributor and it provides a simple user interface to interact
              with it. You have little or no flexibility with component nodes.
              For example, grouping a data frame can be a component node, if all
              the required variables are converted to input dialogs or a simple
              key-value input.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nodes communicate with each other through the edges. nodes will
              always run in a sequential order except a node is called directly
              and it does not depend on an output from another node. Selecting a
              node opens up an actions pane, the configuration of the actions
              pane will vary depending on if the node is a component node or a
              code node. Component nodes will have a user interface for inputs,
              the code nodes however will have a code interface with more
              flexibility to control and alter the underlying code directly
            </p>

            <h2>Software Architecture</h2>
            <p>
              At a high level the user will interact with OpenFlow through the
              client built in React (TypeScript), with IBM Carbon as the design
              system. The API Gateway that serves API calls from and to the
              client is built in GO, and just serves as a proxy between the
              client and the background processing queues.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the backend processing task queues, I will be experimenting
              with Uber Cadence, where I intend to use it to spin up nodes that
              have been pre configured with python environments. For metadata
              storage, I will use a PostgreSQL database and a Redis cache. I had
              also thought about using a Redis queue to handle the background
              jobs, however I wanted to give cadence a try for this. Things may
              change in the future depending on how flexible cadence is.
            </p>
            <p>
              Obviously there is the question of scaling. while this is still
              intended to be a deploy-on-your-own docker compose workflow, I
              believe I can possibly look into a scalable cloud option in the
              future.
